# birmingham-teamplateful
A 48-hour hackathon project for <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/datafest.net/globalurbandatafest/">2015 Global Urban Datafest</a> in Birmingham, AL. Check out our <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/datafest.net/globalurbandatafest/projects/grocery-bus">team page</a>!

## Motivation
40% of the city of Birmingham, Alabama is classified as a <a href="http://apps.ams.usda.gov/fooddeserts/fooddeserts.aspx">food desert</a>, defined by the USDA as areas "without ready access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food." It has been suggested that these communities may best be served by rolling grocery buses, which are able to bring affordable, fresh groceries to parts of the city where fresh food is rare.

## Grocery Bus
To address this problem, we developed the front end for a web application, Grocery Bus, an inventory tracking web application for rolling grocery stores, with an "all-in-one" UI; it's intended to be used by both consumers, and managers of these grocery buses.
